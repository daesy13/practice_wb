#why will you use a list instead of a tuple

#Lists
my_list = [10,20,30,40,50]
# for i in my_list:
#     print(i)

#Tuples
my_tup = (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)
# for i in my_tup:
#     print(i)

#Dict
#dictionary -> hash table
#iter.items give us one result back at a time
#rather than putting all of the items into memory
my_dict =  {'name': 'Joe', 'age': '27', 'ocupation': 'Software Engineer'}
# for key, val in my_dict.iteritems():
#     print "My {} is {}".format(key, val)

#Set
my_set = {10,20,30,40,50,10,20,30,40,50}
#print a set of NO repeated values
# for i in my_set:
#     print(i)
